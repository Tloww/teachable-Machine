#  Flower Classifier (Rose vs Lily)

This project is an **image classification task** using **Teachable Machine** and **Python**.  
The goal is to classify images into two categories: **Rose** and **Lily**.  

---

##  Steps I Followed

1. **Collected Images**  
   I collected images for two flower types: *Rose* and *Lily* (JPG/PNG).  

2. **Trained the Model**  
   I used [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) by Google to train the model with the two classes.  

3. **Exported the Model**  
   Exported the model in **Keras (.h5)** format and downloaded the `labels.txt` file.  

4. **Wrote Python Code**  
   Created a Python script (`test3.py`) that loads the model, processes an input image, and predicts the class.  

5. **Tested the Model**  
   - Tested with a **Lily** image → model prediction shown in screenshot 1.  
   - Tested with a **Rose** image → model prediction shown in screenshot 2.  

6. **Saved Results**  
I took screenshots of the terminal outputs to show the predictions.
